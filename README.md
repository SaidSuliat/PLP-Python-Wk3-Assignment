# Discount Calculator

This Python script defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount percentage is **20% or more**, the discount is applied; otherwise, the original price is returned.

## Features

- Takes an original price and a discount percentage as input.
- Applies the discount only if it's 20% or higher.
- Prompts the user for input and displays the final or original price based on the discount rule.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. You will be prompted to enter:
   - The original price of the item.
   - The discount percentage.
3. The script will output the final price after applying the discount (if applicable).
